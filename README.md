About: 
This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer. The coolest part about this game is that you can choose unlimited opponents! You can keep playing as many rounds as you want without any restrictions.
When you select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, the computer randomly picks its choice, and the game shows you who won. It also keeps track of the scoreâ€”wins, losses, and ties.
